# TW2-Bot
An exercise on multi-objetive optimization problems, using python

 This program is still unfinished, it can run, but it's rubish and it lacks some elements.
 The Memory.py file stores data about the buildings, Sim0.py is the simulation file, wich 
can run without any changes to the code, however, the Bot0.py needs adaptations until the 
line 30, after that the code should be fine.

 That's the first version of the code, it looks more like a test, it still needs
some improvement, both in intelligence and in coding, I'm still using the time
package to compensate for the internet delay, further more I'll implement wait.until
commands, wich should solve the crashing problems.
